/* 
-Local Networking = ethernet for example, or wifi

-Remote Networking = internet, start and end of data transfer

-Protocol = rules for data transfer

-Port = a specific endpoint for data transfer

-IP Address = a unique identifier for a device on a network

OSI 7 Layer Model:
1. Physical Layer
    electrical tranmission cable or wire - copper wire. unstructured raw bit stream, no device addressing, collisions occur
2. Data Link Layer
    MAC address for each peice of hardware is globally unique. frames. controlled access to layer 1. 
    ethernet, wifi, bluetooth, etc. - structured raw bit stream, device addressing, no collisions
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer

TCP/IP 4 Layer Model:
1. Application Layer
2. Transport Layer
3. Internet Layer
4. Network Access Layer

q: what is the difference between a protocol and a port?
a: a protocol is a set of rules for data transfer, and a port is a specific endpoint for data transfer

q: what is the difference between a port and an IP address?
a: a port is a specific endpoint for data transfer, and an IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network

q: what is decimal to binary conversion?
a: 1. divide the decimal number by 2
2. write down the remainder
3. divide the quotient by 2
4. write down the remainder
5. repeat until the quotient is 0
6. read the remainders from bottom to top
7. the binary number is the remainders read from bottom to top
8. if the binary number is not 8 bits long, add 0s to the front until it is 8 bits long
9. the binary number is the binary representation of the decimal number

q: what is binary to decimal conversion?
a: 1. read the binary number from right to left
2. multiply each digit by 2 to the power of its position
3. add all of the products together
4. the decimal number is the sum of all of the products
5. the decimal number is the decimal representation of the binary number

q: what is transport session?
a: a transport session is a connection between two devices that allows for data transfer
