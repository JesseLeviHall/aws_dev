Test 5
You can use Amazon Cognito to deliver temporary, limited-privilege credentials to your application so that your users can access AWS resources. Amazon Cognito identity pools support both authenticated and unauthenticated identities. You can retrieve a unique Amazon Cognito identifier (identity ID) for your end-user immediately if you’re allowing unauthenticated users or after you’ve set the login tokens in the credentials provider if you’re authenticating users.
That is why the correct answer for this question is: Cognito ID.
