Annotations are simple key-value pairs that are indexed for use with filter expressions. Use annotations to record data that you want to use to group traces in the console, or when calling the GetTraceSummaries API. X-Ray indexes up to 50 annotations per trace.

VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Amazon S3. After you’ve created a flow log, you can retrieve and view its data in the chosen destination.

The Lambda proxy integration allows the client to call a single Lambda function in the backend. The function accesses many resources or features of other AWS services, including calling other Lambda functions.

You can publish your own metrics to CloudWatch using the AWS CLI or an API. You can view statistical graphs of your published metrics with the AWS Management Console. CloudWatch stores data about a metric as a series of data points. Each data point has an associated time stamp. You can even publish an aggregated set of data points called a statistic set.

If your origin is an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, you can use a certificate provided by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). You can also use a certificate that is signed by a trusted third-party certificate authority and imported into ACM. Note that you can’t use a self-signed certificate for HTTPS communication between CloudFront and your origin.

Hence, setting the Viewer Protocol Policy to use Redirect HTTP to HTTPS and setting the Viewer Protocol Policy to use HTTPS Only are the correct answers in this scenario.

Resharding enables you to increase or decrease the number of shards in a stream in order to adapt to changes in the rate of data flowing through the stream. The Kinesis Client Library (KCL) ensures that for every shard there is a record processor running and processing that shard. It also tracks the shards in the stream using an Amazon DynamoDB table.
you should ensure that the number of instances does not exceed the number of open shards.
