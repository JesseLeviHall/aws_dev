/* 
A local secondary index maintains an alternate sort key for a given partition key value. A local secondary index also contains a copy of some or all of the attributes from its base table;
Strongly consistent reads are not supported on global secondary indexes.

Minimum capacity and maximum capacity are both incorrect because these are the limits that you set for Auto Scaling actions, not for Manual scaling.
