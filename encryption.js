/* 

Approaches to encryption:
-at rest: 
    -encrypt the data before it is stored in the database. 
    

-in transit
    -encrypt the data before it is sent over the network. its like a secret tunnel that wraps the data. 

symmetric encryption means:
- same key for encryption and decryption. good for local security, not transference. 

asymmetric encryption means:
- two keys, one for encryption and one for decryption.



Key Concepts: 
-plaintext: 
-ciphertext: the encrypted text, takes the key, generates plaintext
-key: the secret code that is used to encrypt and decrypt the data.
-encryption algorithm: eg blowfish, AES, RC4...
-steganography: hiding data in a pattern decipherable fom a key.
