public vs private services from the networking perspective 
public services are accessible from the internet
private services are not accessible from the internet

aws private zones are called vpc's virtual private clouds
ec2 instances are vpc's that can only acced by the internet if you allow it and configure it

aws public zones are called regions, they are connected to the internet but not accessible by the public internet - eg s3 bucket
