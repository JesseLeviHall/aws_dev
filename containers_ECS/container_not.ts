/* 
Virtualization means running different OS's on on peice of hardware. 
Containers on the other hand, are a way to run multiple isolated processes on a single OS instance.

On ec2 for example it would be a waste to run the same OS on mubliple instances and a different app on each instance, just use containers to use one instance and run multiple apps on that instance in seperate environments(containers)
