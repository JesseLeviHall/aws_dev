=========CI/CD in aws==============================
CI/CD is handled within AWS by CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy and CodePipeline.
These generally corespond to 4 stages of a development pipeline:
Code (source control), Build, Test, Deploy

the above are all isolated products, and AWS code pipeline brings them together.  

When it comes to architecting a codepipeline there must be a source code stage where the code is kept. 
************ The source must be tied to one and only one branch within a repository.

One common method is to create a Dev pipeline, and a Main pipeline
Each with a source stage which uses AWS CodeCommit. If a commit is added to dev pipeline, it would go through test and build and deploy to maybe elastic beanstalk or other aws services which form part of the dev or test env. 

The main pipeline would be triggered by a commit to the main branch. This would then go through the same stages as the dev pipeline, but would deploy to a production environment.

two files that you need to understand:
Buildspec:
This is a file that is used by AWS CodeBuild to build your application. It is a YAML or JSON file that defines the commands to run, and the environment to run them in.
The buildspec file is stored in the root of your source code repository.

appspec: 
This is a file that is used by AWS CodeDeploy to deploy your application. It is a YAML or JSON file that defines the commands to run, and the environment to run them in.

Code Deploy can deploy out to one or more ec2 instances using a dployment group. Or directly into Elastic Beanstalk or OpsWorks.
deploying to elastic beanstalk requires an environment name. With OpsWorks you need to specify a stack and a layer. Code Deploy can also deploy to cloudformation to create a new stack or update one or create or update and change set. It can also deploy to ECS (elastic containter) and optionally with blue/green deployment model. Code Deploy also deploys to Service Catalog or Alexa Skills Kit. Also, just to store the built version of repo in s3 bucket. 

CodeCommit: 
When you create a repo, you can connect using HTTPS / SSH (keyPair)
with HTTPS: you need to authenticate using a username and password
Both connections are configured in the IAM (users), select user,  sec credentials tab. 

-In repo settings, set notifications or create triggers which say on a commit invoke a lambda function. This where event driven workflows happen

CodePipeline:
continuous delivery service you can use to model, visualize, and automate the steps required to release your software. You can quickly model and configure the different stages of a software release process. CodePipeline is the glue that automates the steps required to release your software changes continuously. 

pipelines are built from stages, you can have as many as you want. 
Each stage has one or more actions, single, sequential or parallel.
Each action has a provider, which is the service that performs the action. Movement between stages can require manual approval. 
Actions within stages can consume or generate artifacts (like files stored on an s3 bucket linked to the pipeline)

Any changes to the state of the pipeline, stages, or actions, generate an event which is published to the event bridge event bus. From there you can use any consumer of events such as lambda or notifications. 

You can interact with pipelines in CloudTrail for monitoring API calls or throught the console UI

CodeBuild:
fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. With CodeBuild, you donâ€™t need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. CodeBuild scales continuously and processes multiple builds concurrently, so your builds are not left waiting in a queue.
You only pay for the compute resources consumed during build process. 
Designed to be alternative to something like Jenkins. 
- Used for both build and test environments.
- Can be used to build artifacts for deployment to AWS services such as Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, or Amazon ECS.
- Can be used to build artifacts for deployment to on-premises servers.
- Can be used to build artifacts for deployment to any server that can access the artifacts in an Amazon S3 bucket.
- Uses docker for build env by default, can be customized. 
- integrates with KMS for encryption, IAM for permissinos, VPC for networking, CloudTrail for API or auditing, s3 and cloudwatch for logs and can store build metrics there. It pushes build events to eventbridge

Architecturally, it gets source from github, codecommit, codepipeline, or s3. Then builds and tests.  This is customized using the buildspec.yml (this file HAS to be in the root of the source) SPELLED buildspec.yml
The buildspec.yml has four parts (phases):
It defines ENV variables, inc from parameter store or secrets-manager, and the Artifacts(what stuff to put where)
- install: install base levels of env (frameworks, not dependencies)
- pre_build: sign into things or install package dependencies
- build: build commands
- post_build: push docker image, explicit notifications
